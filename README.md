# README.md

This project was made to learn and practice git skills by solving practice problems from codingbat.com and leetcode.com.

Below is the project structure of the codebase:

```
codingbat/
    L CodingBat.java
leetcode/
    L lib/
        ListNode.java
        TreeNode.java
    L src/
        LeetCode.java
Main.java
README.md
```

The **codingbat** directory contains the file *CodingBat.java*. This file cotains the class CodingBat, and each method found in this file is a solution to a problem from codingbat.com

The **leetcode** directory contains two folders, one called *lib* and the other called *src*. 

- The **lib** folder contains leetcode's public definitions for list structures like list nodes and tree nodes, and are defined in *ListNode.java* and *TreeNode.java* respectively.

- The **src** folder contains the file *LeetCode.java*, which contains the class LeetCode, and each method found in this file is a solution to a problem from leetcode.com

The **Main.java** file is file used to test solutions written in CodingBat.java and LeetCode.java before submitting to their online solutions page.
