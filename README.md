# README.md

This project was made to learn and practice git skills by solving practice problems from codingbat.com and leetcode.com.

Below is the project structure of the codebase:

```
codingbat/
    L CodingBat.java
leetcode/
    L LeetCode.java
    L LeetCode.md
    L ListNode.java
    L TreeNode.java
.gitignore
README.md
```

The **codingbat** directory contains the file *CodingBat.java*. This file cotains the class CodingBat, and each method found in this file is a solution to a problem from codingbat.com

The **leetcode** directory contains the files *LeetCode.java*, *LeetCode.md*, *ListNode.java*, and *TreeNode.java*

- **LeetCode.java** contains the class LeetCode, and each method found in this file is a solution to a problem from leetcode.com
- **LeetCode.md** is a markdown file to show the leetcode question prompt being sovled with example test cases
- **ListNode.java** is leetcode's public definition of a list node
- **TreeNode.java** is leetcode's public definition of a tree node

The **.gitignore** file ignores Main.java, used to test solutions in *CodingBat.java* and *LeetCode.java*
